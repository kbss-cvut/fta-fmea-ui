# FTA and FMEA tool

This tool provides two types of reliability analyses - `Fault Tree Analysis (FTA)` and `Failure Modes and Effects
Analysis (FMEA)`.
It is primarily focused on FTA which offers possibilities for system partonomy definition,
[FTA construction](./doc/fta-construction-algorithm.md) and an automatic conversion of the trees to FMEA tables given the unified ontological model. Detailed description of its features is described in [user manual](./doc/user-manual.md).

## Execution

```shell script
npm install
npm run watch
npx serve
```

## Registration
Tool also supports configuration to disable registration of new user within security, but by default, everybody can register. 
There are two flags which need to be set:

* Backend - Run application with `-Dspring.profiles.active=admin-registration-only` profile
* Frontend - Set `REACT_APP_ADMIN_REGISTRATION_ONLY` in [.env.prod](.env.prod) to true




## Recommended Development Approach

- webpack setup
- styling (css/sass)
- routing
- user context
- data flow through the app
- modules binding
- consultation
